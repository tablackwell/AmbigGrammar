# AmbigGrammar
Derives all terminal strings of a given length for a given ambiguous grammar

Taken from the python file:
This program, when fed an imput file of a set of rules for a context 
free grammar, will generate all terminal strings up to given length.
Arguments must be passed from the command line in the format:       
python3 derive.py [-lA] B, where A is the integer size of the string,
and B is the name of the text file containing the grammar.           
Grammar  rules  must appear  one  rule per line, with each symbol    
separated from the next symbol by white space


super generic honor-codey disclaimer: If you're a CSCI312 student looking at this, please don't copy my code. You're better than that. You won't learn from using my code, and theres probably a better way to program it anyways. Besides, I have no clue if CSCI312 still uses this project.
